# Recommendation-System
In this code, we will walk through the process of scraping a web page for data and using it to develop a recommendation system, using built-in python libraries. Scraping the website to extract useful data will be the first component of the blog. Moving on, text analysis will be performed to alter the extracted data and make it appropriate for our recommendation system to use. Finally, our content-based filtering recommender system, will calculate the cosine similarity of each blog with the rest of the blogs and then suggest three comparable blogs for each blog post.
